# Directives

Builder lets you use directives in your R files and via the command line.

## Command line

You can pass definitions via the command line using `-D` flags. This is useful for setting build-time constants without modifying your source files.

**Syntax:** `-D<NAME>` for boolean flags, or `-D<NAME> <value>` for valued definitions.

```bash
./builder -input srcr -output R -DDEBUG -DTEST '"a string"' -DXXX 42
```

Note: Command-line definitions override file-based `#define` directives.

## #define

Define macros or constants that will be replaced throughout your code. All occurrences of the defined name will be replaced with the specified value.

**Syntax:** `#define NAME value`

```r
#define PI 3.14159
#define STRING "hello world!"

x <- PI  # becomes: x <- 3.14159
print(STRING)  # becomes: print("hello world!")
```

## #ifdef

Include a code block only if the specified name is defined (either via `#define` or command-line `-D` flag).

**Syntax:** `#ifdef NAME ... #endif`

```r
#ifdef DEBUG
cat("debugging!\n")
#endif

# With #else for alternative path
#ifdef DEBUG
cat("debug!")
#else
cat("world!")
#endif
```

## #ifndef

Include a code block only if the specified name is NOT defined. This is the opposite of `#ifdef`.

**Syntax:** `#ifndef NAME ... #endif`

```r
#ifndef PROD
cat("Not in production mode")
#endif
```

## #if

Evaluate an R expression and include the code block if the result is TRUE. The expression is evaluated using the embedded R interpreter and supports any valid R expression that returns a logical value.

**Syntax:** `#if R_EXPRESSION ... #endif`

```r
#define VERSION 3

#if VERSION > 2
cat("Using new API\n")
#endif

#if XXX > 1
cat("it's 1!\n")
#endif
```

## #elif

Chain multiple conditions together. Only the first matching branch is included.

**Syntax:** `#ifdef|#ifndef|#if ... #elif NAME ... #else ... #endif`

```r
#ifdef BACKEND_POSTGRES
db <- connect_postgres()
#elif BACKEND_SQLITE
db <- connect_sqlite()
#else
db <- connect_default()
#endif
```

## #else

Provide an alternative code path for conditional blocks. Used with `#ifdef`, `#ifndef`, or `#if` to specify code that should be included when the condition is false.

See the `#ifdef` example above for usage.

## #endif

Close a conditional compilation block. Required for all conditional directives (`#ifdef`, `#ifndef`, `#if`).

## #error

You can use `#error` to stop compilation and print an error message.

```r
#ifdef DEBUG
#error "DEBUG mode is not supported"
#endif
```

## #for

Generate repetitive code by iterating over a numeric range. The loop variable is replaced using the `..variable..` syntax within the loop body.

**Syntax:** `#for VARIABLE in START:END ... #endfor`

```r
#for i in 1:5
validate_col_..i.. <- function(x) check(x$col..i..)
#endfor
```

Expands to:

```r
validate_col_1 <- function(x) check(x$col1)
validate_col_2 <- function(x) check(x$col2)
validate_col_3 <- function(x) check(x$col3)
validate_col_4 <- function(x) check(x$col4)
validate_col_5 <- function(x) check(x$col5)
```

The range is inclusive on both ends. Multiple occurrences of `..variable..` in each line are all replaced.

## #unique

Define a variable that is replaced with a unique identifier. Each `#unique` declaration generates a value in the format `._unq.N` where N is an incrementing integer starting at 0. Useful for generating unique names to avoid conflicts in generated code.

**Syntax:** `#unique VARIABLE`

```r
#unique ID
#unique OTHER

x <- "ID"    # becomes: x <- "._unq.0"
y <- "OTHER" # becomes: y <- "._unq.1"
```

## Nesting Limitation

Nested conditionals are **not supported**. Each `#ifdef`/`#ifndef`/`#if` block must be independent:

```r
# NOT supported
#ifdef A
  #ifdef B
    code
  #endif
#endif

# Use combined conditions instead
#if A && B
  code
#endif
```

## Built-in directives

### ..FILE..

A directive that is automatically replaced with the current source file path. Useful for debugging and logging to track which file generated specific code.

```r
cat("Processing file: ..FILE..\n")
# If in srcr/analysis.R, becomes: cat("Processing file: srcr/analysis.R \n")
```

### ..LINE..

A directive that is automatically replaced with the current line number in the source file. Useful for debugging and error tracking to identify the exact location of code execution.

```r
cat("Executing line ..LINE..\n")
# If on line 42, becomes: cat("Executing line 42\n")
```

### ..OS..

A directive that is automatically populated with the current operating system. Useful for conditionally compiling code based on the current OS.

```r
cat("Running on: ..OS..\n")
# becomes: cat("Running on: Linux\n")
```

### ..DATE..

A directive that is automatically populated with the current date (compile time).

```r
cat("Running on: ..DATE..\n")
# becomes: cat("Running on: 2026-01-01\n")
```

### ..TIME..

A directive that is automatically populated with the current time (compile time).

```r
cat("Running on: ..TIME..\n")
# becomes: cat("Running on: 12:00:00\n")
```

### ..COUNTER..

A directive that is automatically replaced with a unique incrementing integer, starting at 0. Each occurrence of `..COUNTER..` in the source code is replaced with the next value in the sequence. Useful for generating unique identifiers or labels.

```r
x <- ..COUNTER..  # becomes: x <- 0
y <- ..COUNTER..  # becomes: y <- 1
z <- ..COUNTER..  # becomes: z <- 2
```
